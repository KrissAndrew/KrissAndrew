Hey there!

My name is Kriss Andrew. I am currently a student at Queensland University of Technology, working my way through the final year of my four year dual degree for a bachelor of IT (computer science) / bachelor of science (biology).

I am currently pursuing a career in software engineering, I am commited to continuous learning and open to any technology related opportunities.
