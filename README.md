I’m a dedicated and versatile Software Engineer with a strong background in technology and leadership. With a Bachelor of Information Technology (Computer Science) and a Bachelor of Science (Biology), I’ve cultivated a diverse skill set that combines technical expertise with strategic problem-solving. 

I have spent the last year working as a Software Development Engineer at CSG, where I contribute to innovative software solutions and collaborate with cross-functional teams in an agile environment. My past experiences as a Personal Trainer and a Rifleman in the Australian military have helped shape my strong communication, leadership, and organisational skills, enabling me to excel in high-pressure situations.

I am passionate about continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to grow, whether through exploring new technologies or further expanding my expertise in software engineering and system design.
