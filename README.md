Hey there!

My name is Kriss Andrew. I am currently a student at Queensland University of Technology, working my way through the third of my four year dual degree for a bachelor of IT (computer science)/ bachelor of science (biology).

I am interested in pursuing a career in web development. At the moment I am working my way through The Odin Project (TOP) and teaching myself how to build websites/apps using React/React Native.
